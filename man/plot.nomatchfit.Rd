\title{Plot method for nomatchfit objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{nomatchfit}(x, effect = NULL, ci_type = NULL, color = "#0072B2", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{nomatchfit} created by \code{\link[=nomatch]{nomatch()}} or \code{\link[=matching]{matching()}}.}

\item{effect}{The effect measure to plot next to the cumulative incidence plots. By default,
this is the \code{effect} measure chosen in the main function call. Must be one of \code{risk_difference}, \code{risk_ratio},
or \code{relative_risk_reduction}.}

\item{ci_type}{Character string specifying the type of confidence interval band to plot. By default,
\code{"wald"} if available, otherwise set to \code{"percentile"} or \code{none}.
One of \verb{"wald", "percentile", "simul"}, or \code{"none"}. Must choose a \code{ci_type} whose lower
and upper bounds are already computed in \code{estimates} component of \code{x}.}

\item{color}{Aesthetic value to map data values to. Default: \code{"#0072B2"} (blue)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}
}
\value{
a ggplot2 object with three faceted panels (for cumulative incidences and the chosen effect measure)
}
\description{
Create a panel plot of cumulative incidence and effectiveness estimates across all evaluation time points.
}
\details{
For cumulative incidence panels, y-axis limits are shared across methods to
facilitate comparison. The VE panel uses free y-axis scaling.
