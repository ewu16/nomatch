\title{Get empirical probability distributions g(d|x) and p(x) based on input data}
\usage{
get_gp(df, outcome_time, exposure, exposure_time, covariates, tau)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame representing the target population for the estimated distributions
\itemize{
\item typically, population involves the "analysis-eligible" subset of a given data source
}}

\item{outcome_time}{Name of the follow-up time for the outcome of interest, i.e.
time to either the event or right-censoring, whichever occurs first. Time should
be measured from a given time origin (e.g. study start, enrollment, or age)
for all individuals.}

\item{exposure}{Name of the exposure indicator. The underlying column should
be numeric (\code{1} = exposed during follow-up, \code{0} = never exposed during
follow-up).}

\item{exposure_time}{Name of the time to exposure, measured on the same time scale
as that used for \verb{outcome time}. Set \code{exposure_time} of all unexposed
individuals to \code{NA}.}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of covariates to adjust for when fitting
the hazard models; should include all known confounders of
exposure and censoring.  Covariates must be measured or defined at the chosen time origin.}

\item{tau}{Numeric. Only vaccinated who are at-risk tau days after vaccination are included.}
}
\value{
A list of the following:
\describe{
\item{g_weights}{A data frame containing the covariate-conditional day probabilities.
Columns include \code{group_id} identifying the covariate group, \verb{<exposure_time> specifying the day, }prob\verb{specifying the covariate-conditional day probability, and each variables in}covariates\verb{\} \\item\{p_weights\}\{A data frame containing the covariate probabilities. Columns include }group_id\verb{ identifying the covariate group,}prob\verb{specifying the covariate probability, and each variable in}covariates`}
