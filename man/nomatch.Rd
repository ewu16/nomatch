\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with one row per individual containing the columns
named in \code{outcome_time}, \code{outcome_status}, \code{exposure}, \code{exposure_time}, and
\code{covariates}. Missing values for all columns except \code{exposure_time} are not allowed.}

\item{outcome_time}{Name of the follow-up time for the outcome of interest, i.e.
time to either the event or right-censoring, whichever occurs first. Time should
be measured from a chosen time origin (e.g. study start, enrollment, or age).}

\item{outcome_status}{Name of the event indicator for the outcome. The underlying column should be
numeric (\code{1} = event, \code{0} = censored).}

\item{exposure}{Name of the exposure indicator. The underlying column should
be numeric (\code{1} = exposed during follow-up, \code{0} = never exposed during
follow-up).}

\item{exposure_time}{Name of the time to exposure, measured on the same time scale
as that used for \code{outcome_time}. Must be a non-missing numeric value exposed individuals
and must be set to \code{NA} for unexposed individuals.}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of covariates to adjust for when fitting
the hazard models. Include all known, measured confounders of
exposure and censoring.  Covariates must be measured or defined at the chosen time origin.}

\item{immune_lag}{Non-negative numeric value specifying the time after exposure (sometimes denoted by \code{tau}) that
should be excluded from the risk evaluation period. This argument is
primarily intended for vaccination exposures, where it is common to exclude
the time after vaccination when immunity is still building. Time must be
measured in the same units as that used for \code{outcome_time} and \code{exposure_time}  (e.g. days)
and should reflect the biological understanding of when vaccine-induced
immunity develops (usually 1-2 weeks). For non-vaccine exposures, \code{ immune_lag} can
be set to 0 (no delay period for evaluating risk).}

\item{eval_times}{Numeric vector specifying the timepoints at which to compute
cumulative incidence and the derived effect measures. The timepoints should
be expressed in terms of time since exposure and use the same units
as that used for \code{outcome_time} and \code{exposure_time} (e.g. days). All values must be greater
than \code{ immune_lag} and and should correspond to clinically meaningful follow-up
durations, such as 30, 60, or 90 days after exposure. A fine grid of
timepoints (e.g., \code{eval_times = (immune_lag + 1):100}) can be provided if cumulative
incidence curves over time are desired.}

\item{effect}{Character. Primary effect measure of interest (a contrast of
the marginal cumulative incidences). Either
\code{"risk_ratio"}(default), \code{"vaccine_effectiveness"}  or \code{"risk_difference"}.}

\item{weights_source}{Character string specifying the type of marginalizing weights
to use. Either:
\itemize{
\item \code{"observed"} (default): use  the empirical
distribution of exposure times and covariates among the exposed as the marginalizing weights. This
provides close alignment with the weights implicitly used in matching.
\item \code{"custom"}: use the user-specified weights provided in the \code{custom_weights} argument.
}}

\item{custom_weights}{a \code{list(g_weights, p_weights)} providing weights for
marginalizing the time- and covariate-specific cumulative incidences. Must
have the following format:
\itemize{
\item \code{g_weights}: data frame with columns
\itemize{
\item all variables in \code{covariates}
\item \code{exposure_time} (time of exposure),
\item \code{prob} (probability of exposure at the given time within the covariate-group;
should sum to 1 within each covariate-group)
}
\item \code{p_weights}: data frame with columns
\itemize{
\item all variables in \code{covariates}
\item \code{prob} (probability of covariate-group; should sum to 1 over all covariate groups.)
}
}}

\item{ci_type}{Method for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals. One of
\code{"wald"}, \code{"percentile"}, or \code{"both"}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"wald"} (default): Computes Wald-style intervals using bootstrap standard errors.
See \strong{Confidence intervals} section for details.
\item \code{"percentile"}: Computes percentile bootstrap intervals.
\item \code{"both"}: Computes and returns both Wald and percentile intervals.
}}

\item{boot_reps}{Number of bootstrap replicates for confidence intervals.
Recommended to use at least 1000 for publication-quality results. Use
smaller values (e.g., 10-100) for initial exploration. Default: \code{0} (no
bootstrapping).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for confidence intervals (Confidence level =
100*(1-alpha)\%). Default: \code{0.05}.}

\item{keep_models}{Logical; return the two fitted hazard models used to compute
cumulative incidences?
Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{keep_boot_samples}{Logical; return bootstrap samples? Default:
\code{TRUE}. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if user plans to use \code{\link[=add_simultaneous_ci]{add_simultaneous_ci()}}
to obtain simultaneous confidence intervals.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer; parallel cores for bootstrapping passed to
\code{parallel::mclapply} as \code{mc.cores}. On Unix-like OS only; not available on
Windows. Default: \code{1}.}
}
\value{

\item{estimates}{Named list of matrices containing the cumulative incidence and
effect estimates.
\describe{
\item{\code{cuminc_0}}{ marginal cumulative incidence under no exposure}
\item{\code{cuminc_1}}{ marginal cumulative incidence under exposure}
\item{\code{risk_difference}}{ \code{cuminc_1 - cuminc_0}}

the marginalizing weights used for averaging over exposure times and covariates.}

\description{
\code{nomatch()} estimates marginal cumulative incidences under
exposure and no exposure using a G-computation approach. The method fits two
conditional hazard models- one for each exposure type- and uses
these models to predict time- and covariate-specific cumulative incidences.
These cumulative incidences are then marginalized to compute overall
(marginal) cumulative incidences. By default, the cumulative incidences
are marginalized over the observed distribution of exposure times and covariates
among the exposed. The resulting cumulative incidences can be
summarized as risk ratios (RR = 1 - risk_exposed/risk_unexposed),
vaccine effectiveness  (VE = 1 - RR), or risk differences (RD = risk_exposed - risk_unexposed).
}
\details{
\strong{Modeling.} Two Cox proportional hazards models are fit to estimate
exposure-specific cumulative incidences. For the unexposed model, the outcome is modeled
on the original time scale and includes all individuals, with exposed individuals
censored at their time of exposure. For the exposed model, the outcome is modeled in
terms of time since exposure among individuals who were
exposed and who remained at risk \code{tau} days after exposure. Both models adjust for
the specified covariates to help control for confounding. The second model
also flexibly adjusts for exposure time (by default, as a natural cubic spline with 4
degrees of freedom) to capture time-varying background risk. Predicted risks
from both models are then marginalized over the specified
exposure-time and covariate distributions to obtain G-computation style cumulative
incidence estimates.

\strong{Marginalizing weights.} When \code{weights_source = "observed"}, the marginalizing weights
are the empirical distributions of exposure times and covariates among the
exposed who remain at-risk \code{tau} days after exposure. These weights are
returned in the \code{vefit} object under \code{weights}. They can also be obtained
prior to the call to \code{nomatch()} by calling \code{get_observed_weights()}.

\strong{Confidence intervals.} Wald CIs are constructed on transformed scales:
\eqn{\text{logit}} for cumulative incidence; \eqn{\log{RR}} for risk ratios,
\eqn{\log{1 - VE}} for vaccine effectiveness, using bootstrap SEs. These are
then back-transformed to the original scale. No transformation is used for risk differences.

\strong{Parallelization.} Bootstraps can be parallelized on Unix via \code{\link[parallel:mclapply]{parallel::mclapply()}}
by providing \code{n_cores} argument.
