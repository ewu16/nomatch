\arguments{
\item{matched_data}{A data frame for the matched cohort created using \code{\link[=match_rolling_cohort]{match_rolling_cohort()}}.}

\item{outcome_time}{Name of the follow-up time for the outcome of interest, i.e.
time to either the event or right-censoring, whichever occurs first. Time should
be measured from a chosen time origin (e.g. study start, enrollment, or age).}

\item{outcome_status}{Name of the event indicator for the outcome. The underlying column should be
numeric (\code{1} = event, \code{0} = censored).}

\item{exposure}{Name of the exposure indicator. The underlying column should
be numeric (\code{1} = exposed during follow-up, \code{0} = never exposed during
follow-up).}

\item{exposure_time}{Name of the time to exposure, measured on the same time scale
as that used for \code{outcome_time}. Must be a non-missing numeric value exposed individuals
and must be set to \code{NA} for unexposed individuals.}

\item{immune_lag}{Non-negative numeric value specifying the time after exposure (sometimes denoted by \code{tau}) that
should be excluded from the risk evaluation period. This argument is
primarily intended for vaccination exposures, where it is common to exclude
the time after vaccination when immunity is still building. Time must be
measured in the same units as that used for \code{outcome_time} and \code{exposure_time}  (e.g. days)
and should reflect the biological understanding of when vaccine-induced
immunity develops (usually 1-2 weeks). For non-vaccine exposures, \code{ immune_lag} can
be set to 0 (no delay period for evaluating risk).}

\item{timepoints}{Numeric vector specifying the timepoints at which to compute
cumulative incidence and the derived effect measures. The timepoints should
be expressed in terms of time since exposure and use the same units
as that used for \code{outcome_time} and \code{exposure_time} (e.g. days). All values must be greater
than \code{ immune_lag} and and should correspond to clinically meaningful follow-up
durations, such as 30, 60, or 90 days after exposure. A fine grid of
timepoints (e.g., \code{timepoints = (immune_lag + 1):100}) can be provided if cumulative
incidence curves over time are desired.}

\item{ci_type}{Method for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals. One of
\code{"wald"}, \code{"percentile"}, or \code{"both"}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"wald"} (default): Computes Wald-style intervals using bootstrap standard errors.
See \strong{Confidence intervals} section for details.
\item \code{"percentile"}: Computes percentile bootstrap intervals.
\item \code{"both"}: Computes and returns both Wald and percentile intervals.
}}

\item{boot_reps}{Number of bootstrap replicates for confidence intervals.
Recommended to use at least 1000 for publication-quality results. Use
smaller values (e.g., 10-100) for initial exploration. Default: \code{0} (no
bootstrapping).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for confidence intervals (Confidence level =
100*(1-alpha)\%). Default: \code{0.05}.}

\item{keep_models}{Logical; return the two fitted hazard models used to compute
cumulative incidences?
Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{keep_boot_samples}{Logical; return bootstrap samples? Default:
\code{TRUE}. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if user plans to use \code{\link[=add_simultaneous_ci]{add_simultaneous_ci()}}
to obtain simultaneous confidence intervals.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer; parallel cores for bootstrapping passed to
\code{parallel::mclapply} as \code{mc.cores}. On Unix-like OS only; not available on
Windows. Default: \code{1}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{nomatchfit} containing:
\describe{
\item{estimates}{Named list of matrices containing the cumulative incidence and
effect estimates.
\describe{
\item{\code{cuminc_0}}{ marginal cumulative incidence under no exposure}
\item{\code{cuminc_1}}{ marginal cumulative incidence under exposure}
\item{\code{risk_difference}}{ \code{cuminc_1 - cuminc_0}}
\item{\code{risk_ratio}}{ \code{cuminc_1/cuminc_0}}
\item{\code{vaccine_effectivess}}{ \code{1 - risk_ratio}}
}
Each matrix has one row per value in \code{timepoints} and columns including the
point estimate (\code{estimate}) and, when requested, confidence limits of the form
(\verb{\{wald/percentile\}_lower}, \verb{\{wald/percentile\}_upper}). }
\item{models}{Fitted Kaplan Meier}
\item{n_success_boot}{Integer vector indicating the
number of successful bootstrap replications per timepoint.}
\item{boot_samples}{(If \code{keep_boot_samples = TRUE}) Named list of bootstrap draws
(stored as matrices) for each term. Rows index bootstrap replicates and columns index \code{timepoints}.}
}
}
\description{
This function is the main function for estimating cumulative incidence
in a matched dataset based on Kaplan Meier estimation. It creates the
analysis dataset and performs the analysis for the matched cohort.
